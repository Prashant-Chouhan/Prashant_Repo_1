<div><h2 id="Description">Description</h2>
<div class="description"><p>Draggable state is an object containing the drag state of a particular DOM node.
It is instantiated and attached via <a href="#/api/ui.drop.$drag#draggable">draggable()</a>.</p>

<p>The Draggable object is attached to a DOM node via jqLite / jQuery's expandostore,
using the key <code>$draggable</code>. However, it is recomended that querying for a node's
Draggable state be done using <a href="#/api/ui.drop.$drag#draggable">draggable()</a> or
<a href="#/api/ui.drop.$drag#isDraggable">isDraggable()</a>, in case the expandostore key is
changed in the future.</p>

<p>This object provides several helpers which may be used in custom draggable node
directives in order to customize the behaviour of drag &amp; drop.</p></div>
<div class="member method"><h2 id="Methods">Methods</h2>
<ul class="methods"><li><h3 id="drag">drag(event)</h3>
<div class="drag"><p>drag is used to continue a mouse drag, and is typically called in response to a mousemove
event.</p>

<p>Like <a href="#/api/ui.drop.$drag.Draggable#dragStart">dragStart()</a>, there are several properties
which are expected to be present in the event object.
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/event.pageX">event.pageX</a> and
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/event.pageY">event.pageY</a> are used
to determine the relative position from the last mouse position, and must be present in
the event.</p>

<p>This method functions simply by adding the difference in mouse coordinates between the
last cached position with the current absolute position of the element, and sets the new
position as an absolute position to the element's style.</p><h4 id="Parameters">Parameters</h4>
<ul class="parameters"><li><code ng:non-bindable="">event – {MouseEvent} – </code>
<p>The event to which dragEnd is responding</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li><h3 id="dragEnd">dragEnd(event)</h3>
<div class="dragend"><p>dragEnd is used to terminate a mouse drag. This is typically called in response to
a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Reference/Events/mouseup">mouseup</a>
event on the document.</p>

<p>This method essentially delegates functionality to the <a href="#/api/ui.drop.$drag">$drag</a> provider
in order to find the appropriate droppable element (if any) to drop over, and attempt to
place the element.</p>

<p>Like <a href="#/api/ui.drop.$drag.Draggable#dragStart">dragStart()</a>, there are several properties
which are expected to be present in the event object.
<a href="#/api/ui.drop.$drop#drop">$drop.drop()</a> makes use of
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/event.clientX">event.clientX</a> and
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/event.clientY">event.clientY</a> if
they are available, which they should be in a mouse event.</p><h4 id="Parameters">Parameters</h4>
<ul class="parameters"><li><code ng:non-bindable="">event – {MouseEvent} – </code>
<p>The event to which dragEnd is responding</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li><h3 id="dragStart">dragStart(event)</h3>
<div class="dragstart"><p>dragStart is meant to be called in response to a mouse event such as mousedown.
This routine is bound to the element's mousedown event during the construction of
the Draggable state.</p>

<p>If it is desirable to simulate an event, the only properties which are actually
used in the event are Event.pageX and Event.pageY, which respectfully represent the
position relative to the left edge of the document, and the position relative to the
top edge of the document.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/event.pageX">event.pageX</a>
and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/event.pageY">event.pageY</a>
for more details.</p><h4 id="Parameters">Parameters</h4>
<ul class="parameters"><li><code ng:non-bindable="">event – {MouseEvent} – </code>
<p>The event to which dragStart is responding</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li><h3 id="finish">finish()</h3>
<div class="finish"><p>The finish method is a simple helper, called by
<a href="#/api/ui.drop.$drop.Droppable#drop">Droppable.drop()</a> in order to terminate the dragging
interaction.</p>

<p>This method simply restores the original css <code>position</code> property to its original pre-drag
value, and clears the currentDrag value.</p>

<p>This should be considered a private method for the time being, because it is likely to
be removed from <a href="#/api/ui.drop.$drag.Draggable">Draggable</a> in the near future.</p></div>
